# Working with Exploratory Data Analysis EDA

# Updating your fork
* Every week, run these commands from your terminal when you're inside the 2021-fall-data-science folder.
	1. `git fetch upstream`
	2. `git merge upstream/master`
__!! If you get this error `merge: upstream/master not something we can merge` when trying to update your fork. Try running this command instead__
	1. `git fetch upstream`
	2. `git merge upstream/main`




# Homework
In addition to the `Exercise-EDA.ipynb` homework, you are also going to have to create your own [Github Pages resume website](https://zd123.github.io/zacks-template-site.github.io/).  Here are two tutorials on how to set it up.  [Tutorial Resource 1](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), and [Tutorial Resource 2](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).  It is optional to use a jekyll template, but recommended cause they are cool. 

Github pages use the [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) instead of HTML/CSS, so they are much easier to edit and maintain. 

Note, __you just have to set up your website__ this week.  Next week we will begin to fill it in.
